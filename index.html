      <p>A graduate of Washburn University, Lora spent over 15 years in Kansas City’s senior healthcare marketing field earning a reputation for being honest, detailed and hard working. With extensive experience in helping seniors transition from their homes to assisted living communities, now she is able to assist seniors on the selling side and knows the importance of making it a smooth transition. She delivers that same dedicated service to each home seller who has entrusted her with selling their most prized possession, their home. A mother to five children, Lora values getting the best education available for her children so you can trust that she will do all of the homework required to help you find and purchase a home in a school district that best meets your children’s educational needs too. So whether you are a first time home buyer searching for your dream home or an empty-nester getting ready to downsize, Lora understands the importance of selling a home for the highest price the market will bear or purchasing a home at the best price and she will take the time to do the research before the process begins and lead you in the right direction. </p>
